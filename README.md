# Clair UI Test app with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to test the bundling of Clair UI.

## To Use

First install the node modules. Clair UI should be imported from the git repository, using the `rachel` branch of my forked repo. You can alias a local copy of the library using `npm link` or the `file` protocol. For example, in your package.json you would add the following dependency:

`"@factorizeteam/clair-ui": "file:../ClairUIV4"`

In the project directory, run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
